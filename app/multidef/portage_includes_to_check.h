// All the include files we want to check to make sure they won't
// cause multiply defined symbols. If some function does cause multiply
// defined symbol errors, the options are to
//
// 0. Make sure you have include guards so that multiple inclusions of
// the include file in a source file is ok
// 1. Move it to a .cc file
// 2. Make it inline
// 3. Make it static
// 4. Enclose it in its own namespace
//
// Option 3 and 4 will cause each translation unit (compiled source file) to
// have it's own copy of the function
