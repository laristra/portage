# Welcome to portage!   {#mainpage}

portage is a hybrid parallel, extensible,
intersection-based remap library that
provides basic remap capability and methods from which one can create a custom
remap.

We aim to provide:
- A modern, modular design - use all or part of portage!
- A conservative, intersection-based remap capability on general polytopal
meshes.
- A pick-and-choose framework for search, intersect, and interpolate algorithms.
- High flexibility for application customization.
- Algorithms that take advantage of both distrubuted and on-node parallelism.
- An _Open Source Community_ for these tools!
